Question:
   a) Type of 4.0 - 5/2
   Grading function: answer=="double"
   Your answer was: double
Way to go! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: An operation on a double and an int produces a double result, the more general of the two types.

Question:
   b) Value of  4.0 - 5/2
   Grading function: answer=="2.0" or answer=="2"
   Your answer was: 2
Way to go! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: 5/2 is computed first, yielding 2.  4.0-2.0 is 2.0. Google Docs changes this to a 2 unfortunately so I have to count that as well.

Question:
   c) Type of "1"+"4.0"+"5"
   Grading function: answer=="String"
   Your answer was: String
Nice job! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: This is a concatenation of three Strings.

Question:
   d) Value of "1" + "4.0" + "5"
   Grading function: answer=="14.05"
   Your answer was: 14.05
Glad you got that one! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: The Strings are appended: "1"+"4.0" is "14.0", and appending "5" to that yields "14.05".

Question:
   e) Type of  5 - 1 / 3
   Grading function: answer=="int"
   Your answer was: int
Glad you got that one! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: Only integers are involved in both operations so the result is an integer.

Question:
   f)  Value of 5 - 1 / 3
   Grading function: answer=="5"
   Your answer was: 5
Way to go! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: 1/3 evaluates to 0 and 5-0 is 0.

Question:
   g) Type of 5.0 - 1 + "2"
   Grading function: answer=="String"
   Your answer was: String
You have chosen wisely! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: The first result is a double but the final result appends the double to a String, so the final result is a String.

Question:
   h) Value of 5.0 - 1 + "2"
   Grading function: answer=="4.02"
   Your answer was: 4.02
Glad you got that one! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: 5.0-1 yields 4.0;  appending "2" produces "4.02".

Question:
   a)  Type of   (6 + 1 / 2 )  < ( 2 + 4 / 3.0 ) 
   Grading function: answer=="boolean"
   Your answer was: boolean
Nice job! You have earned 10 points.

Explanation: The final opeartion here is a comparison, which yields a boolean result.

Question:
   b)  Value of    (6 + 1 / 2 )  < ( 2 + 4 / 3.0 ) 
   Grading function: answer=="FALSE"
   Your answer was: FALSE
You have chosen wisely! You have earned 10 points.

Explanation: 6+1/2 evaluates to the integer 6;  2+4/3.0 evaluates to 3.3333; the result is thus false.

Question:
   a) The probability that it will snow today
   Grading function: answer=="double"
   Your answer was: double
Way to go! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: A probability is between 0 and 1, so a double is needed.

Question:
   b) The name of your favorite movie
   Grading function: answer=="String"
   Your answer was: String
Nice job! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: Movie titles include alphabetic characters which can only be represented by a String, in terms of the data types we have studied so far.

Question:
   c) The number of times you said "Hello" today
   Grading function: answer=="int"
   Your answer was: int
Way to go! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: You have said "Hello" 0, or 1, or 2... times today. So an int is the type for this

Question:
   d) Whether you have a jacket on
   Grading function: answer=="boolean"
   Your answer was: boolean
You have chosen wisely! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: You either have on jacket, or you don't, so boolean is the best type for this.

Question:
   A) Which computation is performed first?
   Grading function: answer=="1" or answer=="2"
   Your answer was: 1
Glad you got that one! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: In a left-to-right reading of the tree, operation 1 is performed first.  But the tree has no left or right orientation, so either operation 1 or 2 could be performed first.

Question:
   B) Which computation is performed last?
   Grading function: answer=="5"
   Your answer was: 5
You have chosen wisely! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: The root of the tree is the last operation performed, so 5 is the right answer.

Question:
   double v = (x+y)/2
   Grading function: answer=="4.0" or answer=="4"
   Your answer was: 4
Way to go! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: This is tricky.  The right hand side is evaluated first, which yields (4+5)/2 = 9/2 = 4, an int. But once this is assgined to v, a double, it becomes 4.0. Thus, 4 is not really a correct answer, but Google docs changes the correct answer 4.0 to that.

Question:
   double v = (x+y)/2.0
   Grading function: answer=="4.5"
   Your answer was: 4.5
Nice job! You have earned 5 points.

Explanation: The sum 4+5 is 9, an int, but dividing that by 2.0 cause the arithmetic to be carried out in double, which yields the double 4.5.  That value is then assigned to v.


Your total score is 100.
